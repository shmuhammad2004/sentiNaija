# Semi-automatic translated emotion lexicon

NOTE: We are doing some update, and we will re-upload it soon !!!


We translated #9,714 [NRC Word-Emotion lexicon](https://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/NRC-Emotion-Lexicon.htm) in to three languages (Hausa, Igbo, and Yoruba). We used Google Translate API for translation. The transslation was verified and corrected by expert translators. Each word is associated with entries from eight basic emotions (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, trust)
