## Manually Annotated Sentiment Lexicon


We selected tweets that we first manually classified as [negative and positive](https://github.com/hausanlp/NaijaSenti/blob/main/sections/annotated_twitter_corpus.md) and tagged words that are positive, negative, and hate words. We provide [sentiment lexicon](https://github.com/hausanlp/NaijaSenti/tree/main/data/annotated_sentiment_lexicon) in three languages : Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba.
